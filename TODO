Make a version (or something) that doesn't rely on :eric and uses
command-line flags for the locations of binaries it calls out to and
directories to use. Investigate packaging with :alexandria and maybe
SBCL, or otherwise see if it can be easy to say "Install SBCL then run
this, presenting programs with these flags."
