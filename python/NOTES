Layers of abstraction in music:

0. Sound waves
Music is made of adding time-shifted frequencies (with specific
durations) together. Middle C is around 261.6 Hz

1. Notes
If you consider "One frequency, played at a particular time and
lasting for a particular duration" to be the simplest grouping in (0),
you can use that as a "note". Notes can then be sequenced, played
together, and so on.

Notes are labeled by dividing the frequency space into "octaves",
which repeat, with notes of the same name but different octaves being
reached by multiplying or dividing by 2 repeatedly.

2. Keys
To name notes (in standard Western music, at least) we divide an
octave up into 12 "semitones". We then choose a starting frequency,
and advance across the octave by adding one or two semitones at a
time. The sequence is 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, so, in a C major chord:

Note | Absolute interval (Semitone offset)
-----|--------
 C   | 0
 D   | 2
 E   | 4
 F   | 5
 G   | 7
 A   | 9
 B   | 11
 C   | 12

This makes the second C be 12 semitones, one octave, above the first.

The starting note is called the "tonic".

[ Examination: G major
Next in the Circle of Fifths from C major.

Note | Absolute interval (Semitone offset)
-----|--------
 G   | 0
 A   | 2
 B   | 4
 C   | 5
 D   | 7
 E   | 9
 F#  | 11
 G   | 12

The semitone offsets are the same.

The labels are: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#

There are twelve of these, one for each semitone in the octave, and
seven notes in a scale (8 counting the octave tonic)

The seven notes *used* in a key are the ones that lie at 0, 2, 4, 5,
7, 9, and 11 semitones from the tonic. The ones that are sharped tell
you the key signature. In C, the lack of a sharp between B and C and
between E and F lines up with the 1-offset notes, which is why the key
is natural.

The circle of fifths works by choosing the tonic that is needed to
increase the number of sharps used by one each time. That's the only
reason for G to follow C, and D to follow that, and so on.

Key of B major:
B  0
C# 2
D# 4
E  5
F# 7
G# 9
A# 11
B  12

Key signature: Sharp C, D, F, G, A

Key of F# major:
F# 0
G# 2
A# 4
B  5
C# 7
D# 9
F  11
F# 12

Still follows, just happen to need to start on a sharp, now.

As a flat:
Notes: A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab

Key of Gb major:
Gb 0
Ab 2
Bb 4
B  5
Db 7
Eb 9
F  11
Gb 12

Key signature: Flat G, A, B, D, E

Note: For some weird reason, the B is written as Cb for this scale
(which you can see in the note list means the same thing).

Key of F major:
F  0
G  2
A  4
Bb 5 - or A#?
C  7
D  9
E  11
F  12

The number of the note in the scale is called the "degree". Here, F is
the 1st dgree, G is the 2nd, and so on.

2. Chords
A chord is a set of two or more notes played together (or separated in
time).

Triad - a chord with three notes. They are:
The "root", a starting note
The "third", three (minor chord) or four (major chord) semitones up
from the root
The "fifth", seven semitones up from the root

In addition, there are "dimished" and "augmented" chords. Diminished
is like minor, but the fifth is only six semitones from the root, and
augmented is like major, but the fifth is eight semitones up.
