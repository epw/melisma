This project is a Lisp program meant to be used to compose music. It
lets Lisp describe a song which will be output to Lilypond, to be
displayed or synthesized.

The idea is for high-level functions to be written which describe a
song in large chunks, instead of individual notes. Parameters should
make it possible to describe the variation seen in music at a
different resolution.
